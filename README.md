# cpp-ud-ROS-robot-capstone
udacity c++ capstone programming assignment using ROS gazebo, teleop, custom nodes and messages to display odometry

## project description
i chose the ROS project, choosing to implement two different nodes, but doing so using many other ROS services in order to learn and understand how all the ROS services work together.  specifically, i started by going through two ROS programming books in order to understand how everything works ('mastering ROS for robotics programming', third edition, joseph and cacace, copyright 2021, and 'hands on ROS for robotics programming', japon, copyright 2020). this took 120+, and involved many (normally small) individual programming assignments in order to work through many different concepts.  while this project is arguably a minimal amount of c++ code, i wanted to select a few end-to-end scenarios that combine various important services and concepts in order to demonstrate a large surface area of what is possible with ROS. 

more specifically, there are three demo tracks that show use of various ROS services:
* diffbot robot shown in gazebo, controlled by teleop with custom odometry display
* use of moveit! and navigation services to create an environment map to support autonomous movement 
* demo of planning and autonomous movement of diffbot through space based on map created in (2) above through rviz control

## file and directory structure
the (more detailed) demo summarized below will refer to the files and how they are used, but the directories under each of the demo solutions are:
### km_diff_robot_gazebo project
* package.xml file:
* CMakeLists.txt file:
* config dir: 
* launch dir:
* msg dir:
* scripts dir:
* src dir:
* urdf dir:

### km_diff_robot_gazebo_auto project
